Each numerical file in this directory is an episode of the task. Each such file contains a json-serialized list, each element of which represents an environment step in the episode. Each step is a list of four elements, [[`time`, time], [`reward`, reward], [`step_type`, step_type], [`action`, action], [`meta_state`, meta_state`], state].



time is a timestamp of the timestep.



reward contains the value of the reward at that step.



step_type indicates the dm_env.StepType of that step, i.e. whether it was first, mid, or last.



action contains the agent action for the step.



meta_state is the serialized meta_state of the environment.



state is a list, each element of which represents a layer in the environment state. The layer is represented as a list [k, [], [], [], ...], where k is the layer name and the subsequent elements are serialized sprites. Each serialized sprite is a list of attributes. See attributes.txt for the attributes contained.



Furthermore, a list of vertices is appended to the attribute list for a serialized for the first timestep in which that serialized sprite appears, or when the sprite has changed shape.
